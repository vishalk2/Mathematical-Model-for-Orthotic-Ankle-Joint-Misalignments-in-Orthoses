### ABOUT
This Research Work involves -
- Study of "Misalignment effects" between the lower-limb (shank and foot) and an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) for an AFO-user.
- 2D Link-segment Mathematical model used to simulate relative motion betweenthe lower-limb and the AFO during walking, stepping down and stepping up activities.
- Statistical analysis of relative motions calculated for 5 test subjects.
- Estimation of Calf Band Travel / Orthosis Strap Movement.
- Prediction of Pressure Points on the shank and the foot.

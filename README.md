# Simulating Ankle Joint Misalignments effects in Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO)
- Study of "Misalignment effects" between Lower limb structure and an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO).
- 2D Link-segment Mathematical model used to simulate relative motion between the limb and the orthosis for a functional range of ankle motion.
- Estimation of Calf Band Travel and Anterior-Posterior(A-P) & Proximal-Distal(P-D) relative motions.
- Prediction of Pressure Points on the leg.
